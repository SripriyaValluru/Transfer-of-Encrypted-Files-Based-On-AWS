BIOINFORMATICS -  the science of collecting and analysing complex biological data such as genetic codes.
This sequence information is analyzed to determine genes that encode proteins, RNA genes, regulatory sequences, structural motifs, and repetitive sequences.


Amino acids are organic compounds containing amine (-NH2) and carboxyl (-COOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid.
20 amino acids appear in the genetic code.

**Protein sequencing is the practical process of determining the amino acid sequence of all or part of a protein or peptide. 

1.It is the projection on a plane of a sequence assuming it is folded as an alpha helix.,which is a spiral structure.....

  ((The alpha helix (a-helix) is a spiral structure, tightly packed, coiled polypeptide.))

    here is the structure of....  Helical Wheel for the model peptide system, where hydrophobic (yellow), basic (blue) and acidic (red) are highlighted.

2.It is the graph b/w the amino acids of protein on x- axis and 

  The hydrophobic moment detects periodicity in protein hydrophobicity.

3.It is a sequence with no clear evolutionary relationship i.e phylogenetic with any known sequence.
